- **Week 3 (October 12, 2020): Slow Start**
	- Game Design
		- [x] rotation as movement cost
	- Gameplay
		- hex curser
			- [x] arrow points from a start to an end point
			- [x] can gray out if not selected
			- [x] multiple cursers can exist simultaneously
		- new pathfinding
			- [x] get relative bridge direction from a point within a cell

		- [x] can change direction
	- Quality of Life
		- [x] refactor pathfinding logic from hex grid into new class

- **Week 4 (November 9, 2020): Version 1.0 Functionality**
	- Game Design
		- [x] hex curser inputs
		- [ ] turns and rounds
		- [ ] what unit mechanics are essential to implement?
	- Gameplay
		- pathfinding and path-building
			- [x] manual path building with direct mouse selection
			- [x] if manual path is too large, A* is used
			- [x] shift allows a unit to retrace cells; otherwise, retracing starts A*
			- [x] unit must remember path until it is allowed to forget 
			- [x] curser indicates if there is an error or if it is selected
			- [x] pieces cannot travel through eachother
		- [x] moves are stored by units until a button is pressed
		- [x] ally collisions causes a random piece to wait
		- main menu and scene navigation
			- [x] main menu

			- [ ] list of base/forts
		- combat
			- [x] moving pieces kill enemies
			- [ ] multiple moving pieces trade eachother off
		- different game modes and solid game manager
			- [x] turn clock/timer
			- [x] simultaneous turns
			- [x] real-time
			- [ ] turn-based
			- [ ] hot seat
