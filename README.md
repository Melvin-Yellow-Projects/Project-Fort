- **Week 3 (October 12, 2020): Slow Start**
	- Game Design
		- [x] rotation as movement cost
	- Gameplay
		- hex curser
			- [x] arrow points from a start to an end point
			- [x] can gray out if not selected
			- [x] animation
		- new pathfinding
			- [x] get relative bridge direction from a point within a cell
			- [x] rotation now is added to the movement cost
		- [x] can change direction
	- Quality of Life
		- [x] refactor pathfinding logic from hex grid into new class

- **Week 4 (November 9, 2020): xxx**

	- Version 1.0 **..sort this later**
		- [x] remove rotation as movement cost ðŸ˜”
		- [x] remove direction as a gameplay factor ðŸ˜”
		- [x] hexpath without A* / build path with just direct mouse selection
		- [x] pieces cannot travel through eachother
		- [x] ally collisions ends moves? or does a piece randomly wait
		- [x] hexcell lights up when mouse is tracing over it
		- [ ] moving pieces kill enemies
		- [ ] single player base/fort 
		- different game modes and solid game manager
			- [ ] turn-based
			- [ ] simultaneous turns
			- [ ] real-time
		- unit variety
			- [ ] Pikeman
			- [ ] Crusader/Horse
			- [ ] Pirate
			- [ ] Wall
		- unit mechancis
			- [ ] horses cannot move onto a square with a Pikeman
			- [ ] crusader has extra movement
			- [ ] walls cannot be killed unless pirate
			- [ ] walls move with priority
			- [ ] walls can be cursed
			- [ ] walls can not be cursed
		- [ ] server client relationship
		- [ ] stable refactoring; code fixes; and comments

	- Version 1.0 Stretch Goals
		- [ ] can pick up an invisible instance of the piece when creating a path
		- [ ] archer
		- [ ] crusader can jump pieces
		- [ ] forts spawn units 
		- [ ] piece model updates

	- Game Play 
		- hex curser
			- [ ] can gray out a section of the path
			- [ ] supports overlapping, curser can go backwards ontop of itself
			- [ ] BÃ©zier implementation
			- [ ] multiple cursers can exist simultaneously and yet still comprehensively
		- move submission
			- [x] moves are stored by units until a button is pressed
			- [ ] pieces on the same cell will abruptly stop eachother's paths
		- travel queue
			- [ ] cells and rotations can be added to a travel queue 1 at a time
			- [ ] left click for selection, right click for execution
			- [ ] hold shift to activate travel queue, otherwise A* is used
			- [ ] unit must remember path until it is allowed to forget 
			- [ ] mouse over cell edge can change a unit's direction in A* mode
	- Quality of Life
		- [ ] comment existing code
		- [ ] refactor existing code
		- [ ] comprehend shader code
	- Other
		- [ ] resume 1 second a day videos
