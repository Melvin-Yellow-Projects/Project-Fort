	- Game Design
		- [x] rotation as movement cost
		- [ ] hex curser inputs
		- [ ] turns and rounds
		- [ ] economy		
		- [ ] cell queue combat flow
	- Gameplay
		- hex curser
			- [ ] arrow points from a start to an end point
			- [ ] can gray out if not selected
			- [ ] can gray out a section of the path
			- [ ] supports overlapping, curser can go backwards ontop of itself
			- [ ] BÃ©zier implementation
			- [ ] multiple cursers can exist simultaneously and yet still comprehensively
		- new pathfinding
			- [x] get relative bridge direction from a point within a cell
			- [ ] rotation now is added to the movement cost
			- [ ] pathfinding display debugger is readded
		- travel queue
			- [ ] cells and rotations can be added to a travel queue 1 at a time
			- [ ] left click for selection, right click for execution
			- [ ] hold shift to activate travel queue, otherwise A* is used
			- [ ] unit must remember path until it is allowed to forget 
			- [ ] mouse over cell edge can change a unit's direction in A* mode
		- [ ] play mode and editor mode revamp
		- [ ] move submission
			- [ ] moves are stored by units until a button is pressed
			- [ ] pieces on the same cell will abruptly stop eachother's paths
		- [ ] basic piece combat
			- [ ] combat animation
			- [ ] dust effect
	- Quality of Life
		- [x] refactor pathfinding logic from hex grid into new class
		- [ ] comment existing code
		- [ ] refactor existing code
		- [ ] comprehend shader code
	- Other
		- [ ] create a 1 second video collection starting from october 1st
		- [ ] resume 1 second a day videos
